# CUB3D

## About

Cub3d is an impressive project that offers a "realistic" 3D graphical representation of the inside of a maze from a first-person perspective.<br />
This captivating project is achieved by implementing Ray-Casting principles, leveraging an array of resources and [documents](https://lodev.org/cgtutor/raycasting.html) available on the internet for guidance.<br />
This synergy between mathematical precision and innovative design allows Cub3d to transform a simple maze into an immersive 3D world, where players can explore and navigate with a truly engaging first-person view.<br />
